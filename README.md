# Implementation-TFG

The Gym Retro framework enables implementation of reinforcement learning in classic
video games. In this project we will explore the creation of automatic playing agents that
learn to play some of these games using Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques. We
will also explore techniques that allow us to intuitively explain the decisions taken by the
trained models. All of this is done by first giving an overview of the theory behind the
algorithms and tools and then applying them in increasingly complex environments.

## Overview

This repository contains all the python notebooks developed for this project as well as the training data used to draw the results obtained with them:
- [Agents](https://github.com/tfg-gym-retro/Implementation-TFG/tree/master/Agents): this folder contains all the trained agents data needed to reproduce the results.
